InstaRitto aims to solve the problem of planning and keeping track of Monthly Shopping / grocery lists in an average family. The current version is very basic, it helps the user to store data in the cloud using firbase API and retrieve the most recent data in a collaborative fashion. Future versions will handle predictive analytics that will provide visualization of grocery requirements upfront for the next month based on past purchases etc.
